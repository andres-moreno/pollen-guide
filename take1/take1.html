<root><h1>Take One. Or, Let's Try To Get the Basics.</h1>

Let's try and make the basics work. How do we do things like the tutorials on Pollen markup: <em>italicize things</em>, make <a href="http://github.com">links to cool things</a>, and, hardest of all, take a single sidenote and make it into <em>three</em> HTML tags that Tufte-CSS needs?<splice-me><label for="sidenoteReference" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input id="sidenoteReference" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" /><span class="sidenote">Here's that sidenote!</span></splice-me>

Observe that <em>this call</em> produces the same result as <em>this call</em>. And Pollen, when targeting HTML, can deal with attributes in the same way: <span class="hidden">this span</span> produces the same output as <span class="hidden">this span</span>. But watch out! If you <code>define</code> a tag like we did with <code>linky</code> to make links, you can't just randomly pass attributes in this way, since <code>linky</code> is expecting two arguments, a URL and some text. This won't work: (missing <lozenge></lozenge>)linky['((class "hidden") (href "/"))]{won't work}.

Build me with <pre>$ raco pollen render take1.html
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9090</pre>
Then visit <a href="http://localhost:9090/take1.html">localhost:9090/take1.html</a>.
